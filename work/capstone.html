            <h4><b class="det-heading">OVERVIEW</b></h4>
            <p class="desc-text">Usability challenges present in existing Government of India (GoI) portals pose
                significant obstacles to citizen engagement and empowerment. The portals have become notoriously known
                for
                being
                unusable. Most GoI websites cover fundamental services such as transport booking and national
                identity/license application. A subset of these sites even trickle down to state-level services
                that
                deal
                with grievance redressal or data access, for example.</p>
            <p class="desc-text">Hence, the aforementioned lack of usability in such a wide range of websites is
                detrimental to the timely handling of citizen-centric needs, many of which are time-sensitive. While
                issues are regularly reported, they are often not catered to for multiple sociotechnical reasons.

            </span>
            <p class="desc-text">To understand the frequency and nature of issues on e-governance websites, I designed a
                survey for users who largely fit their target consumer profile: middle to old-aged individuals. The
                survey asked respondents to list the sites they frequently visited and describe their usual experience
                with the same – specific pain points and/or favourable features. Then, it asked them to list
                functionality requests that could be implemented to resolve the aforementioned pain points or to improve
                user experience as a whole. Lastly, it gauged what proportion of the respondents would be able and
                willing to install the browser extension tool. With an overwhelming 75+ participants, the survey led to
                some enlightening results as summarised below:</p>

                <i class="sub-text">Case study</i>
            </span>
            <p class="desc-text">The survey illuminated how IRCTC might be an ideal choice for a case study as many
                feature requests and complaints were specific to the site. For context: IRCTC is a train booking service
                owned by GoI and used by millions. Thus, I tried to experientially gauge the critical issues associated
                with a foundational user flow on the site — purchasing a ticket.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="desc-text">My experience on the site confirmed the survey’s findings. The IRCTC website displayed
                a wide
                range of issues related to content redundancy, inconsistent styling, and opaque information.</p>

            <h4><b class="det-heading">IDEATION</b></h4>
            <p class="desc-text">By using IRCTC as a specific case, I was able to narrow down the specific design and
                optimisation interventions required according to usability design standards, as shown in the table.
                These interventions were picked based on the expectation that they can eventually be applied across
                other GoI
                e-governance sites without significant modification. Each intervention is linked to a pain point or
                feature request identified in the survey and an IRCTC-centric use case that is implemented in the
                upcoming section. Every intervention is also classified into Creation, Deletion and Edit categories,
                describing what type of action will be executed. This can be used for the extension’s time complexity
                analysis later on.

            <h4><b class="det-heading">IMPLEMENTATION</b></h4>
            <p class="desc-text">The designed tool works in the context of a popup window that operates on top of the
                target tab. All user input and intervention preferences are routed through this popup, which then
                communicates with the background service worker script present in the extension. The background script
                carries out all Chrome API calls such as executing a script, function, or creating a new tab. The
                content script relates the local extension instance to the real webpage instance by modifying the
                existing elements and DOM structure.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="desc-text">This framework allows for real-time, programmatic script injection that is entirely
                controlled by the user’s actions on the popup and the main frame. An interface can produce a button,
                tooltip, or change styles and see the immediate effect of their action on the page with 1 click. The
                popup window itself is designed to minimise data entry while also giving the developer a wide scope of
                intervention options. Some of the existing interventions required more parameterization and fine-tuning
                than the baseline DOM API functions offered, such as removing an element through its display or
                visibility styling. This framework allows for real-time, programmatic script injection that is entirely

                started with defining a problem statement and then supplementing it with user research. Here, I

                background
                played a significant role in my design choices. During development, I went through multiple rounds
                of ideation and sourced an expansive list of enhancements but it was crucial to <b>cover the bases
                    first</b>.
                Instead of attempting to introduce fancy features, I tried to first ensure that fundamental usability
                requirements, such as removing and restyling elements, were satisfied.
