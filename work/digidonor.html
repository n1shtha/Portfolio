            <h4><b class="det-heading">OVERVIEW</b></h4>
            <p class="desc-text">The humanitarian sector suffers from critical challenges when it comes to aid/donation
                transactions. Transparency is often lacking in the management of donations, which has led to a commonly
                recurring pattern of misallocation, fraud and inefficiency. Donors usually have no way of verifying
                first-hand whether their funds are being used for the purpose they had intended. A large part of this is
                due to the centralisation of management, where an aid organisation or other middle-man routes all
                communication between donors and recipients.

            <p class="desc-text">Blockchain-based solutions propose significant potential for improvement in donation
                management by carrying out secure and decentralised transactions.</p>
            <p class="desc-text">Blockchain's distributed ledger ensures transparency by recording every transaction in
                a secure and immutable manner, which is essential for the sensitive information we are storing.
                Hyperledger Fabric, being a permissioned framework, allows for controlled access, ensuring that only
                authorised entities can participate in the network. This feature enables donors and recipients to
                execute user-specific operations on a donation request, right from its initiation to final funding.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-text">Hyperledger Fabric's smart contracts enable programmable and automated transactions,
                eliminating the need for intermediaries. This decentralised approach streamlines the donation process,
                reducing the inefficiency and potential deceit associated with traditional donation channels.</p>

            <p class="desc-text">We wished to first implement this for the context of our university, and then use it as
                proof of concept for larger use cases. Hence, DigiDonor considers 3 distinct users: students (who
                require funds), donors (who provide funds) and outlets (where funds can be expended). To start, students
                submit detailed donation requests on the platform, outlining their needs. Potential donors then explore
                and select a cause aligned with their values, pledging tokens through a fixed rate determined by the
                platform. These tokens are uniquely generated and bound to the selected donation request, ensuring
                transparency. Subsequently, students redeem the tokens directly with designated outlets upon meeting the
                request criteria, and the platform updates the request to close it. This streamlined process, using
                platform-generated tokens as opposed to aid organisations, establishes a secure and traceable system for
                facilitating student donations.

                For the local university context. we worked with a small network with 1 client and 1 organisation with 2
                peers, as shown in the figure below. The three types of users: students, donors, and outlets are
                connected to a central client upon registration which broadcasts all transactions to the network.

                Each user type has role-specific functionalities on their dashboard. The student dashboard allows the i)
                querying of past requests by the student using their username and ii) the creation of an asset (request)
                transaction using a platform-generated request ID. The donor dashboard has the ability to i) generate
                and get tokens by creating a verified connection to the network, ii) query past donations by the donor
                using their username, iii) query all open requests by creating a verified connection to the network, and
                iv) create a request modification transaction by using a platform-generated pledge ID, array of tokens
                and username. Lastly, the outlets play a minimal role in our setup; they only come in when it’s time to
                redeem the token so their functionality is to create a request modification transaction by using the
                aforementioned pledge ID and a student’s username to verify and accordingly update the request’s status.
                This is a visualisation of the client-side application user flow, which takes care of all three
                trajectories.
