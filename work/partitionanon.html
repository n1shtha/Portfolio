            <h4><b class="det-heading">OVERVIEW</b></h4>
            <p class="desc-text">The India-Pakistan Partition, which took place in 1947, is a significant event in
                global history with lasting repercussions. The Partition marked the end of British colonial rule in the
                Indian subcontinent and the creation of two independent nations – India and Pakistan. This seismic event
                was accompanied by widespread communal violence, mass migrations, and large-scale loss of life.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-text">The Partition was globally significant due to its role in the broader narrative of
                decolonisation, its impact on regional geopolitics, and the ongoing implications for communal relations
                in South Asia. Its effects are still felt today, making it a crucial chapter in history and an abundant
                area for study.</p>
            <p class="desc-text">
                Citizens of India and Pakistan know the Partition through personal history, which means a lot is
                missing: partly because of the messiness of memory, and partly because people have repressed or erased
                memories of violence. Thus, in traditional accounts of the Partition, there is reason to cast doubt on
                existing and missing data. In narratives where identity is a matter of life and death, what does it mean
                for a text to not reveal a character’s gender, religion, etc.? And what does it mean to not reveal their
                name, something so basic to their identity? In many ways, these are also concerns of data: what does it
                mean when a discipline that strives to categorise and label everything cannot cognise something in a
                text?

        <div class="row gap-3 mb-5 hidden">
            <h4><b class="det-heading">IDEATION</b></h4>
            <p class="desc-text">In the months leading up to this project, our team had already been logging low-level
                data on novels and poems from Partition literature. This included data on characters, locations and
                events. We spent a lot of time fleshing out the data for each data group, given the weight of the
                stories we were dealing with. This required a great deal of inference to gauge information like a
                character’s links to a mob or a location’s religious affinity. Based on such insights, we had a solid
                point of reference to draw relations between data points.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-text">
                As a Digital Humanities project, there was significant scope for technical intervention. Hence, to stay
                true to our goal of bringing background characters to light, we planned to extract unnamed characters
                from our database and conduct a qualitative analysis on the same. Additionally, we wished to focus on
                one or two texts that dealt with character naming in unique ways. From our earlier close reading of the
                texts, we knew the two would be Saadat Hasan Manto’s <i>Mozail</i> and Khushwant Singh’s <i>A Train to
                    Pakistan</i>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row gap-3 mb-5 hidden">
            <h4><b class="det-heading">IMPLEMENTATION</b></h4>
            <p class="desc-text">Through targeted querying of the database, we were able to source the numbers of
                unnamed characters at any given event or location. Since we wanted to focus on high-intensity events, we
                picked events that featured religious conflict in our Partition texts. Our maps show the percentage of
                unnamed characters in events of religious conflict in various texts that deal with partition. This data
                is further categorised using the gender identities of the unnamed characters, and the modalities of the
                spaces they are found in.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-text">
                In developing the interactive essay, we employed a scrolly-telling format, which involves presenting
                content dynamically and sequentially as the user scrolls through the content. To show changes in
                geospatial elements, we used Mapbox for a flexible map component. One of our priorities was to describe
                our findings in an intuitive format since the site was to be published online for perusal. Hence, the
                interface was designed to be easily navigable, with a particular emphasis on the reader’s independent
                exploration. This means that a visitor of the site should be able to play around with data
                visualisations and draw conclusions in conjunction with our existing research. This was achieved through
                the incorporation of multiple view options with radio buttons, along with clear legends and thoughtful
                styling. Additionally, accessibility was a key consideration. We used colourblind-friendly palettes
                throughout to ensure inclusivity and a seamless experience for all users.

                        By focusing on a character’s geospatial and narrative path, we could get insight into the
                        lifespan of unnamed characters within the novel. This would provide a nuanced perspective on the
                        role they play within conflict.

            <p class="desc-text"> This was an ideal introduction to the application of computational methods in
                humanities research. I realised the power of data in <b>uncovering hidden narratives</b> since we
                focused on
                amplifying the voices of individuals otherwise overlooked in literary accounts. Another key lesson was
                our conscious commitment to <b>pervasive inclusivity design</b>. This ensured that our work was
                accessible to
                a large audience across disciplines. That was my biggest takeaway, working with and for
                <b>multidisciplinary</b> groups. I was the sole Computer Science student in the group and used this
                unique opportunity
                to collaborate with Literature students.
